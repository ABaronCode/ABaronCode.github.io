                        My capstone project was voted best for the 2024 spring semester. The project translated an algorithm AirView from Java to Python. Then implemented the Python rendition of AirView into the instance of the open source IQEngine project. This implementation allowed the team to enhance the functionality of the annotation gathering and visuals of the IQEngine.

                        In the middle of Covid, I scooped up a second major in Computer Science. I was inspired by my first course in Computer Science, I was excited to learn more. It also was cohesive as Physics also utilizes programming to run simulations on concepts not easily replicated in a lab.
